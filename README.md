# MPN Lookup React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

A simple Single Page App that will provide the MPN for the given number  
of positively identified cells in the QuantiTray water Assays. All relevant detail can be found here:  
[QuantiTray System](https://www.idexx.com/en/water/water-products-services/quanti-tray-system/)

The MPN values are simply the contents of these following fancy spreadsheets or tables in PDF format, consolidated  
into a simple javascript object.

And this is the 'solution' offered by the manufacturer/distributor:

### Why this app though?

It was an easy task to implement using [mpn-lookup](https://github.com/jonathan-gartland/mpn-lookup), and I wanted to learn React. It seemed like relatively simple way to do so.
