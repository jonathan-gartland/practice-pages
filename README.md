# React MPN Lookup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

A simple Single Page App that will provide the MPN for the given number  
of positively identified cells in the QuantiTray water Assays.\
The values are simply the contents of these following PDF's, consolidated  
into a simple javascript object.

And this is the 'solution' offered by the manufacturer/distributor.

## Why this app?

It was an easy task to implement, and I wanted to learn React, this seemed like relatively simple way to do so.
